# Assignment-3

In this assignment, I attempted to create a website for a a fictional pizza shop called Pete's Pizzeria. 

> Home Page
On the Home Page is an introduction and welcome to the pizzeria's website. The number included is fictional and put soley for the purpose of humor.

> Order Page
The Order Page allows you to select the necessary components for your pizza, such as the dough, the sauce, the cheese and the toppings. 
It also includes the option for a discount to those who have had a birthday recently, provided they have the necessary ID proof to back it up.

> Checkout Page
This was supposed to display the subtotal and total for the cost of the pizza before confirming your order.
